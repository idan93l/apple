Apple mock-up website:

1) Brief scan on the website itself in order to find potential elements - scrolling    threw the website itself, and inspect it by using the developer tools. I used the    developer tools mostly for extracting data - images, fonts, svg files, favicon    and icons.

2) I decided to build every element on its own (html and CSS) rather than building    all the elements on html and only than cascade them. I believe that it is better    to dedictate time for building, refining, and making the neccesary adjustments    for each element without the background noise of the other untouched html    elements.

3) the main division in my opinion was, from top to bottom:
 - Fixed flexed navbar.
 - flexed red banner.
 - 3 flexed headers. The first header contains 3 images that have a slight rotate       animation.
 - Gridded main section.
 - Flexed footer.

4) For some reason, Netlify could not deploy the background images from the css         files. In order to fix this problem, I needed to to put this styling method in       the html file (inline CSS).
